- First, import the models you wish to use into your application’s views.py file.
- Within the view you wish to use, query the model to get the data you want to present.
- Pass the results from your model into the template’s context.
- Setup your template to present the data to the user in whatever way you wish.
- If you have not done so already, map a URL to your view.
